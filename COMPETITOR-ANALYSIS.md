## Key Market Gaps & Opportunities

- Share workouts with friends
- Compete on leaderboards

### 4. **No True All-in-One Solution**
Users need 2-3 apps to get complete functionality:
- Workout tracker
- Nutrition tracker
- Progress photos
- Plate calculator
- Mobility/warm-up guide

### 5. **Wearable Integration Is Fragmented**
Only BodBot has decent wearable support, but it's buggy.

### 6. **Beginner to Advanced Gap**
- Fitify too basic for advanced users
- Alpha Progression too complex for beginners
- No app bridges this gap well

### 7. **Customer Service Crisis**
BodBot's terrible support is infamous. This is a competitive advantage waiting to be claimed.
